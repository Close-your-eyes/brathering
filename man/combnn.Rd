\title{Get all element combinations of every lengths, except zero}
\usage{
combnn(
  x,
  order_matters = F,
  repeats_allowed = F,
  min_len = 1,
  consecutive_only = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector}
}
\value{
list
}
\description{
The empty element is not included.
Combinations -> subsets, order doesnâ€™t matter, no repetition. This is binomial
coefficients.
Permutations -> subsets, order matters, no repetition. With factorial().
Cartesian product -> subsets, order matters, with repetition. This is expand.grid
of all lengths of x.

\examples{
vec <- c("this", "is", "a", "character", "vector")
out <- combnn(vec)
